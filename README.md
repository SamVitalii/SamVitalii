### Vitalii Samorodov

Hello there! My name is Vitalii and I am a junior Node.js Developer currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am passionate about building scalable applications and have experience with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and MySQL. Recently, I have been exploring the Nest.js framework and I must say, I really enjoy working with it.

Apart from that, I am a team player with great communication skills and I am always eager to learn new technologies. Feel free to contact me at samorodov.vitalii@gmail.com for any opportunities. Thank you for taking the time to visit my profile!
